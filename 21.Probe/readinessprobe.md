### Explanation:

- **apiVersion**: Specifies the version of the Kubernetes API being used.
- **kind**: Specifies the type of Kubernetes object (in this case, a Pod).
- **metadata**: Provides metadata about the object, such as its name.
- **spec**: Defines the desired state of the object.
- **containers**: Lists the containers that will run in the Pod.
  - **name**: The name of the container.
  - **image**: The container image to use.
  - **ports**: Specifies the ports that the container will expose.
  - **readinessProbe**: Defines the readiness probe for the container.
    - **httpGet**: Specifies that the probe will use an HTTP GET request.
      - **path**: The path to access on the HTTP server.
      - **port**: The port to access on the HTTP server.
    - **initialDelaySeconds**: The number of seconds after the container has started before the probe is initiated.
    - **periodSeconds**: How often (in seconds) to perform the probe.
    - **timeoutSeconds**: Number of seconds after which the probe times out.
    - **successThreshold**: Minimum consecutive successes for the probe to be considered successful after having failed.
    - **failureThreshold**: When a probe fails, Kubernetes will try `failureThreshold` times before giving up.

### How it works:

- The readiness probe checks the `/healthz` endpoint on port 80 of the container.
- It starts checking 10 seconds after the container starts (`initialDelaySeconds: 10`).
- It performs the check every 5 seconds (`periodSeconds: 5`).
- If the probe does not get a response within 1 second, it times out (`timeoutSeconds: 1`).
- The container is considered ready after one successful probe (`successThreshold: 1`).
- If the probe fails 3 times consecutively, the container is marked as not ready (`failureThreshold: 3`).

This configuration ensures that the container is only marked as ready when it can successfully respond to the `/healthz` endpoint, helping to prevent traffic from being sent to a container that is not yet ready to handle it.
