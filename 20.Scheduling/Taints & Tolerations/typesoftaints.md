# Types of Taints and Tolerations in Kubernetes

## Types of Taints
Taints are applied to nodes and consist of a **key**, **value**, and **effect**. The effect determines how the taint influences pod scheduling. The three main effects of taints are:

### NoSchedule
- **Description**: Pods that do not have a matching toleration will not be scheduled on the node.
- **Example**: If a node is tainted with `key=value:NoSchedule`, only pods with a corresponding toleration can be scheduled on that node.

### PreferNoSchedule
- **Description**: The scheduler will try to avoid placing pods without matching tolerations on the node, but it is not guaranteed.
- **Example**: A node tainted with `key=value:PreferNoSchedule` will prefer not to schedule non-tolerant pods, but it may still do so if no other options are available.

### NoExecute
- **Description**: This effect not only prevents new pods from being scheduled on the node but also evicts existing pods that do not tolerate the taint.
- **Example**: If a node has `key=value:NoExecute`, any existing pods without a matching toleration will be removed from that node.

## Types of Tolerations
Tolerations are applied to pods and allow them to be scheduled on nodes with specific taints. Tolerations consist of a **key**, **operator**, **value**, and **effect**. The main types of operators used in tolerations are:

### Equal
- **Description**: This operator indicates that the toleration matches the taint exactly.
- **Example**: A pod with a toleration defined as `key=value` can tolerate a taint `key=value`.

### Exists
- **Description**: This operator indicates that the toleration matches any taint with the specified key, regardless of its value.
- **Example**: A pod with a toleration defined as `key: Exists` can tolerate any taint with that key.

### NotIn
- **Description**: This operator indicates that the toleration matches if the value does not exist in the specified list.
- **Example**: A pod with a toleration defined as `key NotIn (value1, value2)` can tolerate any taint with that key as long as its value is neither `value1` nor `value2`.
