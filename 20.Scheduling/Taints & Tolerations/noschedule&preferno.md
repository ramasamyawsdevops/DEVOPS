| Enforcement Level          | Strict (pods without toleration cannot be scheduled) | Soft (scheduler tries to avoid scheduling, but may do so if necessary) |
| Pod State if Tainted       | Pods remain pending until a suitable node is found | Pods may be scheduled on the tainted node if no alternatives exist |
| Use Case                   | Use when you want to strictly prevent certain pods from running on specific nodes | Use when you prefer to avoid certain nodes but want flexibility in scheduling |
