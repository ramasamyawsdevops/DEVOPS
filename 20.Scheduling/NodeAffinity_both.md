# Scheduling Scenarios

## Scenario 1: Nodes Available

### Nodes in the Cluster:
- **Node A**: `disk-type=ssd`
- **Node B**: `disk-type=hdd`

### Scheduling Outcome:
- The scheduler finds **Node A**, which meets both the required condition (`disk-type=ssd`) and the preferred condition (also `disk-type=ssd`).
- The pods will be scheduled on **Node A**.

---

## Scenario 2: No Matching Required Nodes

### Nodes in the Cluster:
- **Node A**: `disk-type=hdd`

### Scheduling Outcome:
- The scheduler finds no nodes with `disk-type=ssd`.
- Since there are no nodes that satisfy the required condition, none of the pods will be scheduled at all, regardless of any preferred conditions.

---

## Scenario 3: Some Matching Required Nodes but No Preferred

### Nodes in the Cluster:
- **Node A**: `disk-type=ssd`
- **Node B**: `disk-type=hdd`

### Scheduling Outcome:
- **Node A** satisfies the required condition (`disk-type=ssd`), while **Node B** does not.
- The pods will be scheduled on **Node A** since it meets both required and preferred conditions.

---

## Conclusion

Having the same conditions in both required and preferred affinity rules is valid and can help reinforce specific scheduling requirements. However:
- **Required rules** are strict: if those conditions are not met by any nodes, the pods will not be scheduled at all, regardless of any preferences specified.
- This approach can be useful when you want to ensure that certain criteria are strictly enforced while still allowing for some flexibility in scheduling preferences among suitable nodes.
