Sure, here is an example of a startup probe for a database application in a Kubernetes YAML configuration file, along with a detailed explanation:

```yaml


apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: database-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: database-container
    image: postgres:latest
    ports:
    - containerPort: 5432
    startupProbe:
      exec:
        command:
        - pg_isready
        - -U
        - postgres
      initialDelaySeconds: 30
      periodSeconds: 10
      failureThreshold: 6
```

### Explanation:

- **apiVersion**: Specifies the version of the Kubernetes API being used.
- **kind**: Specifies the type of Kubernetes object (in this case, a Pod).
- **metadata**: Provides metadata about the object, such as its name.
- **spec**: Defines the desired state of the object.
- **containers**: Lists the containers that will run in the Pod.
  - **name**: The name of the container.
  - **image**: The container image to use (in this case, PostgreSQL).
  - **ports**: Specifies the ports that the container will expose.
  - **startupProbe**: Defines the startup probe for the container.
    - **exec**: Specifies that the probe will execute a command.
      - **command**: The command to run inside the container to check if it is ready. Here, `pg_isready` is used to check the readiness of the PostgreSQL database.
    - **initialDelaySeconds**: The number of seconds after the container has started before the probe is initiated.
    - **periodSeconds**: How often (in seconds) to perform the probe.
    - **failureThreshold**: When a probe fails, Kubernetes will try `failureThreshold` times before giving up.

### How it works:

- The startup probe runs the `pg_isready` command to check if the PostgreSQL database is ready.
- It starts checking 30 seconds after the container starts (`initialDelaySeconds: 30`).
- It performs the check every 10 seconds (`periodSeconds: 10`).
- If the probe fails 6 times consecutively, the container is considered to have failed its startup (`failureThreshold: 6`).

This configuration ensures that the container is only marked as started when the PostgreSQL database is ready to accept connections, helping to prevent other containers from trying to connect to the database before it is ready.
